# KP_Belly_Button_Challenge
Module 12 challenge for bootcamp

In this assignment, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

I created a chart that shows the top 10 bacteria found in a specific sample based on the ID drop downmenu. I also displayed the specific participant's demographic information

I also created a bubble chart to visually show the bacteria found in each sample.
